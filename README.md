The initial FASTQ data for this study were obtained from the BICCN dataset, specifically from 'M1/Rhesus/download_urls.txt' and 'M1/Chimpanzee/download_urls.txt.' Subsequently, quantitative counts were generated using Cellranger with the scripts 'M1/Rhesus/1.fasta2counts.sh' and 'M1/Chimpanzee/1.fasta2counts.sh.'
